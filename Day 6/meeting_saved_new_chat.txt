	//Comon usecase of colelction ie   Stack and Queue in  reallife scenario are as below :
	        //1. Stack : Undo mechanism in text editors , Browser history etc
	        //2. Queue : Print spooling , CPU task scheduling , Call center systems etc
	        //3. Priority Queue : Emergency room triage ,
	
2026-01-14 10:15:52 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	Task scheduling in operating systems , Network packet routing etc
	        //4. Deque : Browser history navigation , Undo/Redo functionality in applications , Task scheduling with varying priorities etc
	        //5. Concurrent Collections : Real-time data processing , Multi-threaded web servers , Parallel computing tasks etc
	        //6. list use cases : Data binding in UI frameworks , Implementing stacks and queues , Storing collections of items for processing etc

	        //Step1: Define a stack to hold integer values ex.  
	        //Step2: Push some values onto the stack
	        //Step3: Pop a value from the stack and display it
	        //Step4: Peek at the top value of the stack without removing it( All fucntinoality are provided by Stack class in System.Collections.Generic namespace)
	        //Step5: Check if the stack contains a specific value( Searching functionality)
	        //Step6: Display the current count of items in the stack(Using Count property of Stack class)
	        //Step7: Clear the stack of all items(Using Clear method of Stack class)
