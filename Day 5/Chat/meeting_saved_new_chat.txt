	//In C#.NET We use Exception Handling for handling errors and exceptions in a controlled manner.
	//With E.H we can gracefully handle runtime errors, maintain program stability, and provide meaningful feedback to users.
	//hence Below staeps are used to implement Exception Handling in C#.NET
	//in .NET There is gloabl exceptino class called System.Exception from where all exception classes are derived.
	//hence .NET follows herirachal exception handling mechanism. Where base class are used to catch general exceptions and derived classes are used to catch specific exceptions.
	//ex : System.IO.IOException is derived from System.Exception class.
	//ex: System.DivideByZeroException is derived from System.ArithmeticException which is derived from System.Exception class.
	
2026-01-13 09:54:10 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	//Common sceanrio where exception handling is used in C#.NET
	//1. File I/O Operations: Handling exceptions when reading from or writing to files.
	//2. Database Operations: Handling exceptions during database connections and queries.
	//3. Network Communications: Handling exceptions during network requests and responses.
	//4. User Input Validation: Handling exceptions when parsing and validating user inputs.
	
2026-01-13 09:54:13 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	//5. Resource Management: Ensuring proper release of resources like file handles, database connections etc. using finally block or using statement.
	//6. API Calls: Handling exceptions when calling external APIs or services.
	//7. Multithreading: Handling exceptions in multi-threaded applications to prevent crashes and ensure thread safety.
	//8. Configuration Management: Handling exceptions when reading configuration settings from files or environment variables.
	//9. Data Serialization/Deserialization: Handling exceptions when converting data to/from formats like JSON, XML etc.
	//10. Custom Exception Handling: Creating and handling custom exception classes for specific application scenarios.
	
2026-01-13 10:15:08 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	public class DailyLimitExceededException : Exception

2026-01-13 10:15:26 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	//Any class that derives from System.Exception is considered an exception class in C#.NET.
	//If any child class inherits from DailyLimitExceededException, it will also be considered an exception class.
	//hence we can create a hierarchy of exception classes in C#.NET by deriving custom exception classes from existing exception classes.

	//4. File: This class provides static methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files, and helps in the creation of FileStream objects.
	//5. Directory: This class provides static methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and subdirectories.
	//6. Path: This class provides methods for working with file and directory path strings.

2026-01-13 16:18:50 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	//below are the types of modes while working with files in C#:
	//read: Opens the file for reading only. An exception is thrown if the file does not exist.
	//write: Opens the file for writing only. If the file exists, it is overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.
	//append: Opens the file for writing only. If the file exists, the write operation appends data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.
	//open: Opens the file if it exists. An exception is thrown if the file does not exist.
	//openorcreate: Opens the file if it exists; otherwise, a new file is created.
	//truncate: Opens the file for writing only and truncates the file to zero bytes. An exception is thrown if the file does not exist.
	//These modes are specified using the FileMode enumeration when creating a FileStream object.
